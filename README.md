# 🛒 Khareed

**Khareed** is an innovative Android-based e-commerce application designed to connect local vendors with nearby consumers, enabling door-to-door delivery of a wide range of daily essentials such as groceries, food & beverages, stationery, and more — all within a 10–15 minute delivery window. The app prioritizes local commerce, supporting small businesses and artisans while offering consumers an efficient, user-friendly, and secure shopping experience.

## 📃 About the App

In today's fast-paced lifestyle, people often lack the time to visit nearby markets to purchase everyday goods. **Khareed** addresses this problem by building a local e-commerce platform that empowers nearby vendors to list their products and deliver them directly to the customer's doorstep with minimal wait time.

Khareed is not just another shopping app — it focuses on **boosting the local economy**, **enabling micro-entrepreneurs**, and **enhancing community-level commerce**.
